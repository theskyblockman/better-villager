  * graphical mods (all mods can be activated by launching them on the villager who is going to be modified.)
    * No A.I (Paper of A.I)
    * Silent (Paper of Silent)
  * trading mods (all mods can be activated by launching them on the villager who is going to be modified, **to get the papers do /trigger trading_items (just the op can use this)**.)
    * If you throw paper on a villager it will block on the block where it is then, on the shulker above it you will be able to retrieve the objers used in the trades then you can modify them simply by replacing the items then press the validate button then you can throw the given object when you threw your paper on the villager (paper of importing trades)
    * Clear all trades (Paper of Trading Clearing)
